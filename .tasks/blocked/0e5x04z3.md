Update CA client (broker) to send token in Authorization header to CA.

Files: pkg/caclient/caclient.go, pkg/caclient/caclient_test.go

Implementation:
- Set Authorization: Bearer header with base64url encoded token
- Remove Token field from request body
- Token parameter is string (already encoded at broker)

Implementation details:

In pkg/caclient/caclient.go:

When making requests to CA:
  encoded := base64.RawURLEncoding.EncodeToString(token)
  req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer " + encoded)

Remove Token field from request body struct.

Update CreateCertificate() method:
- Token parameter is []byte (raw)
- Encode to base64url for header
- Don't include in JSON body

Update tests in pkg/caclient/caclient_test.go:
- All test requests should use Authorization header
- Verify header is set correctly
- Verify body doesn't contain token

CONFIRMED: CA Client (broker->CA) sends user token in Authorization: Bearer header. No change from design decision - this is the inbound side.
