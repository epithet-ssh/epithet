Add a `--no-browser` flag to `epithet auth oidc` that prints the authorization URL to stderr without opening a browser.

This enables automated testing scenarios where the tester can navigate to the URL in a controlled browser context (e.g., MCP tab group) rather than having a separate window opened.

The URL is already printed to stderr with the message "If your browser doesn't open automatically, visit:" - this flag would skip the browser.OpenURL() or custom browser command execution entirely.

Implementation:
- Add `NoBrowser bool` field to AuthOIDCCLI struct
- Pass it through to oidc.Config
- In openBrowser(), if NoBrowser is true, just return nil without opening anything
