Update policy server to verify CA signature from Authorization header.

Files: pkg/policyserver/policyserver.go, pkg/ca/ca.go

Protocol (CA -> Policy Server):
- Authorization: Bearer <base64_sshsig_of_body>
- Body: {token, connection}

Implementation:
- Extract signature from Authorization Bearer header
- Read body bytes
- Verify signature against body using CA public key
- Extract user token from body JSON
- Validate user token (OIDC, etc.)
- Remove Signature field from Request struct

Implementation details:

Policy server side (pkg/policyserver/policyserver.go):
- Parse 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' header
- Token validation happens here (OIDC, etc.)
- Remove token from request body struct

CA calling policy server (pkg/ca/ca.go):
- In RequestPolicy(), set Authorization header when calling policy server
- req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer " + token)
- Remove token from JSON body sent to policy server

Policy request body becomes:
  type PolicyRequest struct {
      Signature  string            `json:"signature"`
      Connection policy.Connection `json:"connection,omitempty"`
  }

Note: Connection is optional - if nil, it's a validation-only request (for hello flow)

DESIGN CHANGE: Policy server auth is now different from broker->CA auth.

NEW PROTOCOL (CA -> Policy Server):
- Authorization: Bearer <base64_sshsig_of_body>
- Body: {"token": "<user_token>", "connection": {...}}

Policy server:
1. Extracts signature from Authorization Bearer header
2. Reads body bytes
3. Verifies signature against body using CA public key
4. Extracts user token from body JSON
5. Validates user token (OIDC, etc.)

This is NOT the user token in the header - it's the CA's signature proving request authenticity.

CODE CHANGE NEEDED in pkg/policyserver/policyserver.go:

CURRENT Request struct:
  Token      string
  Signature  string  // REMOVE - moves to header
  Connection policy.Connection

NEW Request struct:
  Token      string
  Connection policy.Connection

Signature comes from Authorization: Bearer header, verified against body bytes.
