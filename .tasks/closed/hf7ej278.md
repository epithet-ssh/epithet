Currently policy server issues certs with single principal (RemoteUser). Could issue certs with all authorized principals once broker's policy matching (pkg/broker/certs.go) supports matching on user/identity/principals, not just hostname. This would enable certificate reuse across multiple principals. Blocked by epithet-44 (expand policy matching beyond hostname).
